    question: 'What is your greatest strength?',
    answer:
      'My greatest strength is my ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and methodologies. I believe in continuous learning and regularly dedicate time to explore new tools and frameworks.\n\nFor example, when my team needed to implement a real-time feature in our application, I took the initiative to learn WebSockets over a weekend and created a proof of concept that we eventually implemented in production.\n\nThis adaptability has allowed me to contribute effectively across different projects and teams throughout my career.',

    question: 'Describe a challenging project you worked on',
    answer:
      "One of the most challenging projects I worked on was migrating a legacy monolithic application to a microservices architecture while ensuring zero downtime.\n\nThe challenges included:\n- Identifying service boundaries in tightly coupled code\n- Managing data consistency across services\n- Ensuring performance didn't degrade during the transition\n\nI approached this by first creating a detailed dependency map of the existing system, then implementing the strangler pattern to gradually replace components. We used feature flags to control the rollout and set up comprehensive monitoring.\n\nThe result was a successful migration that improved system scalability by 300% and reduced deployment time from hours to minutes.",

    question: 'Explain how you would implement a binary search algorithm',
    answer:
      "Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. Here's how I would implement it:\n\n```javascript\nfunction binarySearch(arr, target) {\n  let left = 0;\n  let right = arr.length - 1;\n  \n  while (left <= right) {\n    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);\n    \n    if (arr[mid] === target) {\n      return mid; // Found the target\n    }\n    \n    if (arr[mid] < target) {\n      left = mid + 1; // Target is in the right half\n    } else {\n      right = mid - 1; // Target is in the left half\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return -1; // Target not found\n}\n```\n\nThe time complexity is O(log n) because we divide the search space in half with each iteration. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.",

    question: 'Design a scalable web service that can handle millions of users',
    answer:
      'To design a scalable web service for millions of users, I would focus on these key areas:\n\n1. **Architecture**:\n   - Use a microservices architecture to enable independent scaling\n   - Implement stateless services where possible\n   - Use event-driven architecture for asynchronous processing\n\n2. **Database Strategy**:\n   - Implement database sharding for horizontal scaling\n   - Use read replicas to distribute query load\n   - Consider NoSQL databases for specific use cases\n   - Implement caching layers (Redis/Memcached)\n\n3. **Load Balancing**:\n   - Use load balancers to distribute traffic\n   - Implement auto-scaling based on traffic patterns\n\n4. **Caching Strategy**:\n   - CDN for static assets\n   - Application-level caching\n   - Database query caching\n\n5. **Monitoring and Resilience**:\n   - Implement comprehensive monitoring\n   - Design for failure with circuit breakers\n   - Use health checks and automatic recovery\n\n6. **Global Distribution**:\n   - Use multiple regions for disaster recovery\n   - Implement geo-routing to direct users to the closest datacenter\n\nThis approach ensures the system can scale horizontally as user demand increases while maintaining performance and reliability.',

    question: 'Explain the concept of database normalization',
    answer:
      'Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves organizing fields and tables to minimize duplication and dependency.\n\nThe main normalization forms are:\n\n1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**:\n   - Each table cell should contain a single value\n   - Each record needs to be unique\n\n2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**:\n   - Table is in 1NF\n   - All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key\n\n3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:\n   - Table is in 2NF\n   - No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depend only on the primary key)\n\n4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**:\n   - A stricter version of 3NF\n   - For any dependency A â†’ B, A should be a super key\n\n5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)** and **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**:\n   - Deal with multi-valued dependencies and join dependencies\n\nBenefits of normalization include:\n- Reduced data redundancy\n- Better data integrity\n- Smaller database size\n- More efficient queries for certain operations\n\nHowever, excessive normalization can lead to performance issues due to the need for complex joins. In practice, some denormalization might be applied for performance optimization.',

    id: 'q8',
    question: 'How do you handle conflicts in a team environment?',
    answer:
      "My approach to handling conflicts in a team environment follows these principles:\n\n1. **Address issues early**: I believe in addressing conflicts as soon as they arise rather than letting them escalate.\n\n2. **Focus on active listening**: I make sure to understand all perspectives by listening carefully before responding.\n\n3. **Separate people from problems**: I focus on the issue at hand rather than making it personal.\n\n4. **Look for common ground**: I try to identify shared goals and interests that can serve as a foundation for resolution.\n\n5. **Collaborate on solutions**: I work with all parties to brainstorm solutions that address everyone's concerns.\n\nFor example, in my previous role, two team members had different approaches to implementing a feature. Instead of letting the disagreement affect the project, I organized a whiteboarding session where both could present their ideas. We evaluated the pros and cons objectively and ultimately created a hybrid solution that incorporated the strengths of both approaches.\n\nThis collaborative approach not only resolved the immediate conflict but also established a precedent for how we would handle technical disagreements in the future.",

    question:
      'What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?',
    answer:
      "In JavaScript, `var`, `let`, and `const` are used for variable declarations, but they have important differences:\n\n**var**:\n- Function-scoped or globally-scoped, not block-scoped\n- Can be redeclared and updated\n- Hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized with undefined\n- Example: `var x = 10;`\n\n**let**:\n- Block-scoped (available only within the block it's defined in)\n- Can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope\n- Hoisted to the top of its block but not initialized (temporal dead zone)\n- Example: `let y = 20;`\n\n**const**:\n- Block-scoped like let\n- Cannot be updated or redeclared\n- Must be initialized at declaration\n- For objects and arrays, the reference cannot change, but properties/elements can be modified\n- Example: `const z = 30;`\n\nBest practices:\n- Use `const` by default for variables that won't be reassigned\n- Use `let` when you need to reassign variables\n- Avoid `var` in modern JavaScript code\n\nExample showing the differences:\n```javascript\n// var example - function scoped\nfunction varExample() {\n  if (true) {\n    var x = 10;\n  }\n  console.log(x); // 10 - x is accessible outside the if block\n}\n\n// let example - block scoped\nfunction letExample() {\n  if (true) {\n    let y = 20;\n  }\n  // console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined\n}\n\n// const example - block scoped and cannot be reassigned\nfunction constExample() {\n  const z = { value: 30 };\n  // z = { value: 40 }; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable\n  z.value = 40; // This works because we're modifying a property, not the reference\n  console.log(z.value); // 40\n}\n```",
